# 8D-Audio-Effect-Processor

Welcome to the 8D-Audio-Effect-Processor repository! This project allows you to create immersive 8D audio effects from any given audio file. 8D audio provides a unique listening experience by simulating the sound moving around the listener's head, offering an enhanced and dynamic auditory sensation. This repository includes a Python script that processes audio files, applies spatial rotations, and adds effects to produce 8D audio.

## Features
- **Stereo to 8D Conversion**: Convert mono and stereo audio files to 8D audio.
- **Beat Detection**: Automatically detects the tempo and beats in the audio file.
- **Spatial Rotation**: Creates the illusion of sound moving around the listener by manipulating stereo channels.
- **Audio Effects**: Adds reverb, treble, and bass effects to enhance the listening experience.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- numpy
- librosa
- soundfile
- sox
